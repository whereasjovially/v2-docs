# Validator Quickstart


## Spin up EL/CL/VL nodes with eth-docker on holesky

- Clone our validator quickstart repo: https://github.com/interstate-labs/validator-quickstart-dev/tree/main
- You can spin up EL/CL/VC nodes with [eth-docker](https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker).

#### Clone the eth-docker repo
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker
./ethd install
./ethd config
    1. Select "HoleÅ¡ovice Network"
    2. Select "Ethereum Node" for the next step.
    3. Select "Geth" and "lighthouse"
    4. Select other settings

#### Make Interstate Specific Changes To Validator Startup
nano .env
# Update "EL_EXTRAS" and "CL_EXTRAS" with the following values
# CL_EXTRAS="--builder=http://mev-sidecar-api:9062 --builder-fallback-disable-checks"
# VC_EXTRAS="--builder-proposals --prefer-builder-proposals"

#### Start The Validator
./ethd up
go install github.com/protolambda/eth2-val-tools@latest
go install github.com/wealdtech/ethereal/v2@latest
eth2-val-tools mnemonic
```
- update the secrets.env file
  - Decide on how many deposits you would like to perform. Generally this would be (amount of testnet ether you possess)/32. Set the `ACC_START_INDEX` and `ACC_END_INDEX` in   **secrets.env** accordingly.

#### Register validators
```
./build_deposits.sh
./exec_deposits.sh
eth2-val-tools keystores --source-mnemonic "$VALIDATORS_MNEMONIC" --insecure --source-min $ACC_START_INDEX --source-max $ACC_END_INDEX
```

This will create `assigned_data` directory which holds `keys` and `secrets` folder.
You should copy these two folders inside `[eth-docker folder path]/.eth/validator_keys` and run `ethd keys import` to import keys for ethd validator instance.

> TIP: In case you don't see any progress from the above command, try pressing Ctrl+C until you can get the following result
```
keys and secrets directories found, assuming keys generated by eth2-val-tools
Keystore files directly under .eth/validator keys will be imported in a second pass

WARNING - imported keys are immediately live. If these keys exist elsewhere,
you WILL get slashed. If it has been less than 15 minutes since you deleted them elsewhere,
you are at risk of getting slashed. Exercise caution

I understand these dire warnings and wish to proceed with key import (No/yes)
```
