# Intro

Interstate currently does two things

## Inclusion Preconfirmation

A preconfirmation is a sale of one or more transaction in an upcoming ethereum block prior to the block occuring. 

Blocks can be bought 1 - ~32 slots in advance (the rough size of the ethereum proposer lookahead). We expect 90% of validators to run a preconfirmation sidecar (same as 90% validators today run flashbots) and offer preconfirmations.

Pricing: The preconfirmation buyer can expect to pay 1-10% in addition gas fees to buy a preconfirmation.

Inclusion preconfirmations give a weaker guarantee than execution preconfirmations in that the transaction may revert if 

## Execution Preconfirmation (coming soon)

An execution preconfirmation is guaranteed to be included in the upcoming block and guarantees the transaction will not revert. Essentially the validator is selling the slot one by one, with the top of the slot being sold first.

This gives the preconfirmation buyer the guarantee that their transaction will not revert.

## Generic Proposer Commitments (coming soon)

These allow the proposer to commit to generic attestations.
