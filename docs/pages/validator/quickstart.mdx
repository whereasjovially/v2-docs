# Validator Quickstart

### Install Dependencies
- Install docker by following: https://docs.vultr.com/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-24-04
- Install Go by following: https://wiki.crowncloud.net/?How_To_Install_Go_on_Ubuntu_24_04
- Install JQ by following: https://jqlang.github.io/jq/
    - ```sudo apt install jq```

### Clone the repo
```
git clone --branch fix/set-builderapi --single-branch https://github.com/interstate-labs/eth-docker.git
cd eth-docker/interstate
```

### Update the secrets.env file

Warning ensure the below fields are unique every time this setup is run. Signing up for two validators with the same private keys will cause a double attestation which will result in a slash of 1 eth and exit.

```
// Set different values for each of these, use `eth2-val-tools mnemonic` command to generate mnemonic
VALIDATORS_MNEMONIC=
WITHDRAWALS_MNEMONIC=

// Set private and public keys which store eth. 
# Public address of wallet which holds testETH
ETH1_FROM_ADDR=
# Private key of the wallet which holds testETH
ETH1_FROM_PRIV=
```

### Run the setup
```
./quickstart.sh // this generates the keystores and deposits to become a validator
cd .. && ./ethd keys import
```

And you're running the interstate-sidecar and an ethereum validator on testnet!
